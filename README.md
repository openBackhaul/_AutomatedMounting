# _AutomatedMounting
UserDemand for automation of the link acceptance

The _AutomatedLinkAcceptance UserDemand shall be redesigned from batch execution once a day to device individual execution of a pre-acceptance by the GU on site.  

This redesign will increase the success rate of performing a link acceptance from 75% to 95%.  

The entire process of installing a new device needs to be fully automated to facilitate the GU waiting for the result of a pre-acceptance on site.  

The following figure shows the high-level design of the application interworking:
